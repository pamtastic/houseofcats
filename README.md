Hello peeps!

My name is Pam and I am a complete newbie in the Web development world. 

I am currently learning bunch of new stuff (this thingie called github as well) so dont judge me (YET). 

Random facts about me: they told my mom I will prob have some difficulties due to being chocked by umbilical cor.

Yet I turned to be bits of genius and nerdy. Have 2 Llms in Law, yet now switching do dev. 

Learned myself to read when I was 5. 

Like to read. 

Good at writing. 

Math kind of as well. 

I dont understand contemporary art. 

Yet I like other art. But not Marina Abramovics performance or similar. 

Have a history crush on Leonardo da Vinci and Tesla. 

And I like photography.

Have 1500 photos on insta. Few selfies. Rest is pics of dogs, cats, food, statues, wine and cities I visited.

And according to my boyfriend, I use all these geniusness to watch cute dog and cats videos on youtube and lame twitter fights.
